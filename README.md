# gradethispython

`gradethispython` is a package that is in development for Python exercise checking in [learnr](http://rstudio.github.io/learnr/). It is designed to mirror the functionalities of [gradethis](https://rstudio-education.github.io/gradethis/). Currently, it only supports output checking but will include code checking as well in future iterations.

**NOTE:** The `python_grade_learnr.py` will eventually live as a separate Python package on its own. This means we will have a standalone Python package that can be used with this `gradethispython` R wrapper package, or by itself making it accessible for general grading use. It will also simplify maintenance by allowing R issues to be opened on this R package, and Python issues to be opened for the Python package.
