# gradethispython

`gradethispython` is a package that is in development for Python exercise checking in [learnr](http://rstudio.github.io/learnr/). It is designed to mirror the functionalities of [gradethis](https://rstudio-education.github.io/gradethis/). Currently, it only supports output checking but will include code checking as well in future iterations.
